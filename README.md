# Stage-Setter

# Introduction
Stage Setter is a comprehensive solution designed for event organizers to manage seating arrangements and for attendees to book their seats. It simplifies the complexities associated with event seat management and reservation, improving the overall experience for both organizers and attendees.

# Audience
This project was developed as part of the Computer Programming -2- course (CSC113) at King Saud University. It is designed for anyone looking to organize or attend events, particularly focusing on students and educators who are interested in the practical application of programming skills in managing real-world scenarios.

# Features
Dynamic Seating Arrangement: Allows organizers to create or modify seating arrangements as needed.

Pricing Management: Supports different pricing tiers for seats like standard and VIP.

Reservation Management: Provides a user-friendly interface for adding, modifying, or canceling reservations.

Exception Handling: Includes comprehensive error and exception management to ensure the system's robustness.

# Branches
Working: This branch includes a fully functional version of the system with the GUI developed by Mohammad using Swing. This version is stable and recommended for those looking for a ready-to-use system.

NotWorking: This branch includes an experimental version where Saeed attempted to implement the GUI using JavaFX. This version may have bugs and is not fully functional.

# Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Java installed on your machine along with the necessary GUI libraries:

For the Working branch: Ensure Swing is installed as this branch uses Swing for the GUI.

For the NotWorking branch: Ensure JavaFX is installed as this branch attempts to implement the GUI using JavaFX.

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the project files. You can compile and run the project using your preferred Java IDE or from the command line. Make sure to check out the appropriate branch depending on which GUI implementation you wish to explore.

# Usage
Organizers can load an existing stage setup or create a new one by specifying details such as stage name, number of seats, and pricing.

Users can view stages, make seat reservations, and manage their bookings.
